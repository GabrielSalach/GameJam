The theme was "If you don't see it, it doesn't exist." 



You play as a kid who needs to find their way to their bed. Unfortunately, their house has turned into a maze and is now haunted by ghosts ! Each time a ghost follows you, your fear meter increases rapidly and once it completes, you lose ! Furtunately, you can close your eyes, which makes the fear meter fill up slowly, you won't be able to see where you're going though so be careful !
